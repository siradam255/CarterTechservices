Credit to OpenAi ChatGPT o1 model which helped me develop this tyoe as human typing app.
Open to anyone who wants to use or modify it in any way, and open to any redistrubution with out any ownership for orgional code.

The firt iteration is just a python scrip with just a few dependencies. Running on python 3.13 using visual stuido as environment.
steps to run:
1. Install python 3.13
2. install Python dependencies for script in the python enviroment your using, I used visual studio and just installed these with pip install, one can probably install globally with out visual studio as a virtual enviroment but i haven't tried this cuz honestly I have had so many issues trying to run a cool script after just installing python from the site and ran in to problem after problem...
If you have no iddea what your doing use visual studio it will save a lot of beginner headaches' I promice you.
  pip install import pyautogui
  pip install import win32gui 
  pip install import threading
3. Run the python scrip.



I created this to allow paste on canvas quizzes so I can paste Ai generated text in to a chrome clipboard controlled app, I.E. Quizzes and the like. 
Currently working on a windows .exe to make life easy on thoes of us who want to paste as human typing or paste where your browser will not let you paste, very inconvenient since instructors using Canvas ( an app many schools use) can indeed see if you pastes content or typed it.

I made this after I looked all over chrome extentions that all wouldn't work when pasting in to canvas.
